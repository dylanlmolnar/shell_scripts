Here are a few shell scripts I have put together for gdal commands I run frequently. 

If you have any questions/suggestions, please reach out to Dylan Molnar.

Before using any of these, ensure you have have gdal installed correctly.
$gdalinfo 

I am often using the same type of tifs, since I order all of my own imagery, but if you are unsure what the specs are of the imagery you are using -- run:
$gdalinfo -mm filename.tif
